# **Landing Page Project**  
### _The Odin Project ‚Äì Foundations Assignment_

---

This is a completed **landing page** built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) **Foundations** curriculum.  
The goal was to recreate a provided design layout using basic **HTML and CSS**, with freedom to customize:

- Fonts  
- Images  
- Text content  
- Color schemes  

> _"Style it your way!"_

---

## üìÑ **Project Overview**

The landing page features:

- **Hero section** with a bold headline, subtext, image, and a CTA button  
- **About section** with icons/images and descriptive value cards  
- **Driver quote section** with a testimonial-style layout  
- **Final call-to-action (CTA)** section  
- **Footer**

---

## üß† **Skills Demonstrated**

- Semantic HTML  
- CSS styling and layout  
- Flexbox for responsive structure  
- Git version control (commit early, commit often!)  
- Using `@media` queries for basic responsiveness  

---

## üìå **Assignment Guidelines**

> **Tip**: Work one section at a time.  
> 1. Structure HTML first  
> 2. Style with CSS (single stylesheet is enough)  
> 3. Be creative ‚Äì just credit any copyrighted material

## üß± **How I Built This Project**

I followed a **section-by-section** workflow ‚Äî building each section from top to bottom and fully completing the styling before moving on.

### Section Workflow:

1. **Top Section (Hero area)**  
   - Built HTML structure (logo, nav, heading, subtext, image, CTA button)  
   - Styled using Flexbox  
   - Made image responsive with `@media` queries  
   - Adjusted spacing, fonts, and layout  

2. **About Section** (formerly "Info Section")  
   - Renamed for consistency with nav link  
   - Includes a background image, heading, subtext, and three value cards  
   - Styled and positioned using Flexbox  
   - Added assets to `/images`

3. **Driver Quote Section (Testimonial)**  
   - Nav-labeled as "Driver"  
   - Contains Lewis Hamilton quote and image  
   - Flexbox used for horizontal layout  
   - Polished padding and alignment for clarity  

4. **CTA Section**  
   - Titled ‚ÄúJoin the Legacy of Champions‚Äù  
   - Centered headline, subtext, and button with Flexbox  
   - Gradient background and responsive layout  

5. **Footer**  
   - Simple layout with left-right text alignment using Flexbox  
   - Clean and responsive design

## ü§î **What I Struggled With (and Fixed!)**

### Hero Image Responsiveness

The hero image originally overflowed on smaller screens. Though not required, I fixed it for better UX.

**Fix:**  
- Set `width: 100%` and `max-width: 700px`  
- Used `@media (max-width: 768px)` to:  
  - Change layout to column  
  - Center-align elements  
  - Reset margins for better balance

Now the hero section scales naturally and maintains structure across screen sizes.
